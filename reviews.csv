JBL Flip 5 Bluetooth Spekaer,I really like the quality of my air buds. And the battery life is phenomenal. And I like how fast they arrived.
JBL Flip 5 Bluetooth Spekaer,"My purchase was Aug 2020. About 3 months ago, they started not producing sound out of both pods... then they worked for awhile. Now, I have been only getting sound out of one pod and then the next time I use them, it might be the other side. This has been going on for about 3 months. Yesterday the connection was horrible, staticy and i switched to regular wire earbuds. I purchased a knock of these for $29.95 several years ago and they lasted just about as long as this $129 set. I would NOT purchase Apple brand again for lack of how long they have lasted. VERY disappointed."
